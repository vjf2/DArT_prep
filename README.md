# DArT_prep
Process data generated by DArT-Seq for SNP selection and format for relatedness calculations and pedigree reconstruction


Filter SNP data based on the following parameters:

-Minor allele frequency
-Call rate
-One SNP per contig (linkage disequilibrium)
-Errors between duplicate samples
-Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium

Format data for use with the following programs:

-FRANz
-Cervus
-Coancestry
-Plink

Create files with subsampled number of snps and individuals for exploratory power analyses

Files
1) SNP_filtering_1.R 
  filters raw SNP data and formats for each program
  
2) Subsampling_Schemes_2.R
  generates subsampled files for power analyses
  
3) batch_plink.bat
  batch script for running plink subsamples

4) Genome_results_3.R
  concatenate results from plink genome analyses and produce heatmaps
